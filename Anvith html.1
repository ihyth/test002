   Hello Anvith welcome to the Apples's Eco system
              Here u can explore the future.  
              HOME POD 
             The HomePod is a small, Wi-Fi-enabled device that 
             packs a set of powerful speakers and microphones 
             to deliver a top-notch music experience to any room. 
            It's a bit like one of those ubiquitous wireless Bluetooth speakers,
             but built into Apple's ecosystem and given the high-end, high-technology, 
            great-user-experience Apple treatment.
